@node Installation
@chapter Installing @value{tramp} into Emacs.
@cindex installation

If you use the version that comes with your Emacs, the following
information is not necessary.  Installing @value{tramp} into your
Emacs is a relatively easy process, at least compared to rebuilding
your machine from scratch. ;)

Seriously, though, the installation should be a fairly simple matter.
The easiest way to proceed is as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Choose a directory, say @file{~/emacs/}.  Change into that directory
and unpack the tarball.  This will give you a directory
@file{~/emacs/tramp-@value{trampver}/} which contains subdirectories
@file{lisp} for the Lisp code and @file{texi} for the documentation.
Make a symbolic link:

@example
$ ln -s tramp-@value{trampver} tramp
@end example

@item
@command{cd} to @file{~/emacs/tramp/} and type @command{./configure}
to configure Tramp for your system.

Running `configure' takes a while.  While running, it prints some
messages telling which features it is checking for.

@item
Type @command{make} to build the byte-compiled Lisp files as well as
the Info manual.

@item
Type @command{make install} to install the Tramp Lisp files and Info
manual.

@item
You can remove the byte-compiled Lisp files and the Info manual from
the source directory by typing @command{make clean}.  To also remove
the files that @command{configure} created, type @command{make
distclean}.

@item
NOTE: If you run into problems running the example @command{make}
command, don't despair.  You can still byte compile the @file{*.el}
files by opening Emacs in @code{dired} (@kbd{C-x d}) mode, at
@file{~/emacs/tramp/lisp}.  Mark the lisp files with @kbd{m}, then
press @kbd{B} to byte compile your selections.

Something similar can be done to create the info manual.  Just change
to directory @file{~/emacs/tramp/texi} and load the @file{tramp.texi}
file in Emacs.  Then press @kbd{M-x texinfo-format-buffer @key{RET}}
to generate @file{~/emacs/tramp/info/tramp}.

@node Installation parameters
@section Parameters in order to control installation.
@cindex installation

By default, @command{make install} will install @value{tramp}'s files
in @file{@value{lispdir}} and @file{@value{infodir}}.  You can specify
an installation prefix other than @file{@value{instprefix}} by giving
@command{configure} the option @option{--prefix=PATH}.  On GNU/Linux
systems, it has been reported useful to apply

@example
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
@end example

If your installed copy of Emacs is named something other than
@option{emacs}, you will need to tell `make' where to find it so that
it can correctly byte-compile the @value{tramp} sources.

For example, to pass the Emacs command to be called:

@example
$ ./configure --with-emacs=emacs24
@end example

If you specify the absolute path of the command, it must not contain
whitespaces.  If you need it, the corresponding path shall be appended
to the @env{PATH} environment variable.

@c The syntax of @value{tramp} file names is different for Emacs
@c and @value{emacsothername}.  The Info manual will be generated for
@c the Emacs flavor choosen in the @command{configure} phase. If you want
@c the Info manual for the other version, you need to set the variable
@c @option{EMACS_INFO} to @command{make}:
@c
@c @example
@c $ ./configure --with-emacs
@c $ make EMACS_INFO=@value{emacsotherdir}
@c @end example

Also, the @option{--prefix=PATH} option to @command{configure} may not
be general enough to set the paths you want.  If not, you can declare
the directories Lisp and Info files should be installed.

For example, to put the Lisp files in @file{~/elisp} and the Info file
in @file{~/info}, you would type:

@example
$ ./configure --with-lispdir=$HOME/elisp --infodir=$HOME/info
@end example

On MS Windows, given Emacs is installed at
@w{@file{C:/Program Files/Emacs}}, you should apply

@example
$ ./configure \
    --with-lispdir='C:/Program Files/Emacs/share/emacs/site-lisp' \
    --infodir='C:/Program Files/Emacs/share/info'
@end example

@noindent
or in Emacs versions prior 24.4

@example
$ ./configure \
    --with-lispdir='C:/Program Files/Emacs/site-lisp' \
    --infodir='C:/Program Files/Emacs/info'
@end example

@command{make} supports the @option{DESTDIR} variable for staged
installation; @inforef{Command Variables, , standards}:

@example
$ make DESTDIR=/tmp install
@end example

Running @command{configure} might result in errors or warnings.  The
output explains in detail what's going wrong.

In case of errors, it is mandatory to fix them before continuation.
This can be missing or wrong versions of @command{emacs}, Emacs
packages, @command{make}, or @command{makeinfo}.

Warnings let @command{configure} (and the whole installation process)
continue, but parts of Tramp aren't installed.  This can happen with
missing or wrong versions of @command{texi2dvi} or
@command{install-info}.  Here you can decide yourself whether you want
to renounce on the related feature (@file{tramp.dvi} file for printed
output, Tramp entry in Info's @file{dir} file), or whether you want to
adapt your @env{PATH} environment variable, and rerun
@command{configure}.  An alternative is calling the missed parts
manually later on.


@node Testing
@section A test suite for @value{tramp}.
@cindex installation
@cindex testing

@value{tramp} comes with an own test suite.  This requires at least
Emacs 24.4.  In order to run this test suite, you call

@example
$ make check
@end example

This test suite uses a mock-up connection method for the tests.  This
means, that no real connection is established, and no password is
required for the tests.  You can change this default behaviour by
tweaking the environment variable @env{REMOTE_TEMPORARY_FILE_DIRECTORY}:

@example
$ env REMOTE_TEMPORARY_FILE_DIRECTORY=@file{@trampfn{sudo,,/tmp}} make check
@end example

If you are using MS Windows, the mock-up trick does not work, and you
must change the default anyway.

The makefile contains a variable @env{TRAMP_TEST_ARGS}, which could be
used for changing connection properties:

@example
$ make TRAMP_TEST_ARGS=--eval\ \\\"\(add-to-list\ \'tramp-connection-properties\ \(list\ nil\ \\\\\\\"remote-shell\\\\\\\"\ \\\\\\\"/bin/bash\\\\\\\"\)\)\\\" check
@end example

If there are errors in that test suite you could not cover yourself,
you might send a @ref{Bug Reports, bug report}.


@node Load paths
@section How to plug-in @value{tramp} into your environment.
@cindex installation

If you don't install @value{tramp} into the intended directories, but
prefer to use from the source directory, you need to add the following
lines into your @file{.emacs}:

@lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/emacs/tramp/lisp/")
(require 'tramp)
@end lisp

If the environment variable @env{INFOPATH} is set, add the directory
@file{~/emacs/tramp/info/} to it.  Else, add the directory to
@code{Info-default-directory-list}, as follows:

@lisp
(add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list "~/emacs/tramp/info/")
@end lisp
